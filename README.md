============

Yet, another scala based crawler framework for extracting the data you need from websites.
In a fast, simple, yet extensible way.


## Roadmap

- Extends Http path
    + Support HTTP Method (GET, POST)
    + Support external parameters in Pattern match. 
* Use akka [routing-dsl/path-matchers.html](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/2.0.3/scala/http/routing-dsl/path-matchers.html)
* Persistent the crawl link queue.
